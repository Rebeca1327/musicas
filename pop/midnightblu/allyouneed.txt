I’ve been holding back this feeling
I know this
Baby what’s the deal of feeling alone?
I don’t care if it ain’t fair
You know damn well
I never lose

Kisses like that
Right on my shoulder
Want it so bad
Baby I told you: No more
Slamming the door
I'm making sure
You won’t forget

So tell me I'm all you need
Need your body on me
There’s no love like ours
I can’t go on
If you’re moving on

I’ll make it hard to leave
Baby we’re in too deep
There’s no love like ours
You can’t go on
If I can’t move on
From our love

I don’t know what it is
But you make it easy babe
Problem is you don’t know
Just how insane when you get
Close to my neck
Baby I bet
You’d never leave

Kisses like that
Right on my shoulder
Want it so bad
Baby I told you: No more
Slamming the door
I'm making sure
You won’t forget

So tell me I'm all you need
Need your body on me
There’s no love like ours
I can’t go on
If you’re moving on

I’ll make it hard to leave
Baby we’re in too deep
There’s no love like ours
You can’t go on
If I can’t move on
From our love

From our love
From our love
From our love
From our love

So tell me I'm all you need
Need your body on me
There’s no love like ours
I can’t go on
If you’re moving on

I’ll make it hard to leave
Baby we’re in too deep
There’s no love like ours
You can’t go on
If I can’t move on
From our love
