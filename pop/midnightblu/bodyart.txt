Let's keep it going now
Ain't got no time for no worries
All I keep seeing is
You on my mind in a blur and I
I keep thinking and thinking of ways we could be more, ooh

Oh, baby, put it on me
Kisses, oh, trace out the lines of my body
Wanna go deep in this love
Baby, I can't get enough of you

Your body's an art in space
You're begging for me stay
I know we're in love, I can't get enough
Oh, name me the time and place
Your body's an art in space
You're begging for me stay
I know we're in love, I can't get enough
Oh, give me the time and place

Oh, se√±orita
She said, it's nice to meet ya
Making you weak in the knees and
Loving you through the weekends, oh
You ain't gotta tell me how bad you want this
Know what you like, babe
We can take it all night long

Oh, baby, put it on me (put it on me)
Kisses, oh, trace out the lines of my body
Wanna go deep in this love
Baby, I can't get enough of you

Your body's an art in space
You're begging for me stay
I know we're in love, I can't get enough
Oh, name me the time and place
Your body's an art in space
You're begging for me stay
I know we're in love, I can't get enough
Oh, give me the time and place

Girl, your body
You're begging for me stay
I know we're in love, I can't get enough
Oh, name me the time and place
Your body's an art in space (you're an body's art)
You're begging for me stay
I know we're in love, I can't get enough
Oh, give me the time and place
