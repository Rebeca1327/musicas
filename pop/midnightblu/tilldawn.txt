Baby think I got issues
But it's with you and I
Said I sound crazy
Made me believe it's all in mind
Baby you test my patience
Swear I ain't gonna lie
Need you to say it
Baby you make it so damn right

Cause I'll remind
You what it
Feels like to be mine
You'll feel it deep inside

You're everything I want
Want
So stay here till the dawn
Dawn

I want your body on mine
I'm on yours tonight
I wanna be yours all my life
I need you close
Babe if I'm not the one
Ain't no where
You can run to

Babe it's just you and me
There ain't nobody else
I know you can't help
To run from
Know it's hard to believe
I know I ain't wrong
We're playing it
Over and over

Cause I'll remind
You what it
Feels like to be mine
You'll feel it deep inside

You're everything I want
Want
So stay here till the dawn
Dawn
No

I want your body on mine
I'm on yours tonight
I wanna be yours all my life
I need you close
Babe if I'm not the one
Ain't no where
You can run to

Mine
You'll feel it deep inside

You're everything I want
So stay here till the dawn
No

I want your body on mine
I'm on yours tonight
I wanna be yours all my life
I need you close
Babe if I'm not the one
Ain't no where
You can run to
