Well, come and get it now, come and get it now
Baby, show me what you're doing, come and turn around
'Cause it's not just a figure of speech, you got me down on my knees
It's getting harder to breathe out

We only met each other just the other day
But you already got me feeling some type of way, now
If I could figure it out, I'd take you back to my house
So we could meddle about

We could meddle about
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
We could meddle about
No, woah-oh-oh-oh-ooh
We could meddle about
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
We could meddle about

Girl, just scream it out
Tell me what you're thinking, oh
I wanna see you undress now
I wanna hear you confess now, oh, oh

We only met each other just the other day
But you already got me feeling some type of way, now
If I could figure it out, I'd take you back to my house
So we could meddle about

We could meddle about
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
We could meddle about
No, woah-oh-oh-oh-ooh
We could meddle about
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
We could meddle about

Back to my house, so we can
Back to my house, so we can
Meddle about
Meddle about (hey)

Well, come and get it now, come and get it now
Baby, show me what you're doing, come and turn around
'Cause it's not just a figure of speech, you got me down on my knees
It's getting harder to breathe out

We only met each other just the other day
But you already got me feeling some type of way, now
If I could figure it out, I'd take you back to my house
So we could meddle about

We could meddle about
Meddle about
We could meddle about
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
We could meddle about
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
