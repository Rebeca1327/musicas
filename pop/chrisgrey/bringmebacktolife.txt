I've been waiting in the dark so long
Drifting through the halls
Listening for your call
You could turn the lights back on
Darling don't you want me here where I belong

Pull me from the static hold me close
Warm me up I'm cold as stone
Make my heart beat fast and save my lonely soul

And bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

When I die don't dig my grave
Save me from this empty life
Till our souls are intertwined
Only you can change my fate
Baby leave it all behind
Be the reason I survive

Pull me from the static hold me close
Warm me up I'm cold as stone
And I know, I'm barely breathing

Baby you
You bring me back to life
Even if the Sun don't rise

Fill my lungs
Feel the blood flowing through my veins
Wake me up with your love again
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

Breathe me in, baby let me know you still care
Bring me back to life, oh
Take my hand, don't let me slip into thin air
Bring me back to life

Oh you bring me back
To life
To life
