Lost in the fog
I fear that there's still further to fall
It's dangerous 'cause I want it all
And I don't think I care what it costs

I shouldn't have fallen in love
Look what it made me become
I let you get too close
Just to wake up alone
And I know you think you can run
You're scared to believe I'm the one
But I just can't let you go

I'd let the world burn
Let the world burn for you
This is how it always had to end
If I can't have you, then no one can
I'd let it burn
I'd let the world burn
Just to hear you calling out my name
Watching it all go down in flames

Fear in their eyes
Ash raining from the blood orange sky
I let everybody know that you're mine
Now it's just a matter of time

Before we're swept into the dust
Look what you made me become
I let you get too close
Just to wake up alone
And I know you think you can run
You're scared to believe I'm the one
But I just can't let you go

I'd let the world burn
Let the world burn for you
This is how it always had to end
If I can't have you, then no one can
I'd let it burn
I'd let the world burn
Just to hear you calling out my name
Watching it all go down in flames

Let it all burn
Oh, I'd burn this world for you
Oh, baby, I'd let it burn
For you

I'd let the world burn
Let the world burn for you
This is how it always had to end
If I can't have you, then no one can
