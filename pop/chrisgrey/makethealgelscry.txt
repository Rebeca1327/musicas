They never wanted me to find you
Told me you can't fight against fate
I get the feeling I've been lied to

Every time that we touch, I hear the angels cry
No, they don't want you to be mine
Our love's got them terrified
Baby, you and I make the angels cry

The ground caves in when we're together
Heaven will never let us in
But this world wasn't made to last forever, oh

Every time that we touch, I hear the angels cry
No, they don't want you to be mine
Our love's got them terrified
Baby, you and I make the angels cry

Ah-Ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
