There's no hate, there's no love
Only dark skies, that hang above
I call your name as I walk alone
Send a signal to guide me home

Light the night up
You're my dark star
And now you're falling away

But I found in you, what was lost in me
In a world so cold and empty
I could lie awake, just to watch you breathe
In the dead of night, you went dark on me

You're the cause the antidote
The sinking ship, that I could not let go
You led my way, then disappear
How could you just walk away and leave me here

Light the night up
You're my dark star
And now you're falling away

But I found in you, what was lost in me
In a world so cold and empty
I could lie awake
Just to watch you breathe
In the dead of night, you went dark on me

Blinded, I can't do this on my own
You're all I've got to guide me home

I could lie awake
Just to watch you breathe
In the dead of night, you went dark on me

Dark on me
Dark on me
Dark on me
Dark on me
Dark on me

I could lie awake
Just to watch you breathe
In the dead of night, you went dark on me
