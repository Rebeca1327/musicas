Remember the feelings, remember the day
My stone heart was breaking
My love ran away

This moments I knew I would be someone else
My love turned around and I felt

Be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you in my life again

Won't you be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you again
No, I don't need you again

You once made this promise
To stay by my side
But after sometimes you just pushed me aside
You never thought that a girl could be strong
Now I show you how to go on

Be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you in my life again

Won't you be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy
But understand
That I don't need you again
No I don't need you again
