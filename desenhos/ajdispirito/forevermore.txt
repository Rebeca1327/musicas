FOREVERMORE - A milk of glass (original by AJ Dispirito)

And when the ice sets in, I'll need you
If only when we met, I knew you
And the our time concludes and far beyond the stars, we flew FOREVER

Tell myself I lost my soul for you... 
Go there after see you never

The planet crumbles slow, it's ending
But through the void, I feel you mending

A shattered world we knew
But somewhere deep, we still pursue forever... FOREVER

Tell myself I gave my heart to you
Lost together, see through FOREVER
In every code, a spark ignites
In shadows, you and I still fight
We're breaking free, we leave the pain
Yet echoes of our loss remain

And when the light grows cold, I'll hold you
For every battle fought, we grew through
Our memories renewed
From fractured lives we once outgrew
Forever... 

Tell myself I found myself in you
Never after, together endeavor
Through the snow, hear the call
Remain distant echos after all
From every fall, we rise anew
For I'll be there, still here with you
