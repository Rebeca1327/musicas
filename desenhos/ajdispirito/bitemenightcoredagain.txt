As she waits at dawn
Looking for a way to escape her lonely heart
(Let them swallow you)
I won't fall down, you need me
We don't follow crowds, we mold them new
I'm not done, believe me
We won't settle down, we'll make them move
Make them mine
(I won't let them)
(I repent them)
(I won't let them swallow you)
(I won't let them)
(I won't let them, I repent them)
(I won't let them, I repent them)
(Swallow you)
BITE ME - Nightcore'd AGAIN - AJ DiSpirito (feat. Zephyrianna)
As it stands, you are no longer my friend
Eat my heart, take my soul, let it burn you
(I won't let go)
What's on my mind?
Well, I'm the farthest gone, you'll find
You should take a look inside
You should tear apart my mind

(Take my mind)

I won't fall down, you need me
We don't follow crowds, we mold them new
I'm not done, believe me
We won't settle down, we'll make them move (we'll make them move)
Make them mine (make them mine)
Make them mine
You should let me go (I'm not worth saving)
We won't let them know (we won't let them know)
Let them carry on (let them swallow you)
You won't save me too
(We won't let them swallow you)

(Let them swallow you)
