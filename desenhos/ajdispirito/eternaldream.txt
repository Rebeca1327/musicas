Eternal Dream - AJ DiSpirito (feat. Elsie Lovelock)

I am tired of this dream
Will it ever end for me?
I don't have the will to know
Can you help me see?

Let my body keep you warm
Let my essence be your breeze
Can you hear me calling?
Please look out for me

Can you set me free?
Will you take my soul away?
Casting me in cold
Bury me in bones
Rest eternally

Will you take me home?
Can we see the Moon again?
Dancing in the dark
Till we fall apart
I can't end this dream
